 Although there is GFDL boilerplate in the doc directory, it was re-released under
 the GNU GPL-3, according to email to the ikarus-users mailing list
 https://groups.google.com/group/ikarus-users/msg/407afbed9b6ca961?dmode=source&output=gplain&noredirect
 whose relevant portion reads:

 Yeah, it's incorrect.  The copyright on the user's guide was changed
 from the GNU-FDL to the GNU-GPL some time around the 0.0.2 release or
 shortly after that.  ...
