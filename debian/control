Description: Scheme compiler and interpreter
 Ikarus is a compiler-based implementation of the Scheme programming
 language which targets the i386 (with sse2) architecture.  It has
 good performance, is rather light weight, is case-sensitive, and
 implements a substantial portion of the language described in R6RS.
